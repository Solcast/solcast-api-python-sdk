## Install
```commandline
pip install solcast
```
or from source: 
```commandline
git clone https://github.com/Solcast/solcast-api-python-sdk.git
cd solcast-api-python-sdk
pip install .
```

The vanilla version doesn't have any dependency. For full functionality,
for example for getting the data into `DataFrames`, and for development, use the `[all]` tag: 
```commandline
pip install .[all] for the dev libs
```

## Basic Usage

```python
from solcast import live

df = live.radiation_and_weather(
    latitude=-33.856784,
    longitude=151.215297,
    output_parameters=['air_temp', 'dni', 'ghi']
).to_pandas()
```

Don't forget to set your [account Api Key](https://toolkit.solcast.com.au/register) with: 
```export SOLCAST_API_KEY={your commercial api_key}```

## Contributing
Tests are run against the Solcast API, you will need a key to run them. 
They are executed on `unmetered locations` and as such won't consume your credits.

```commandline
pytest tests
```
