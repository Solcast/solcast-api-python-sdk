# Welcome to Solcast
A simple Python SDK that wraps [Solcast's API](https://docs.solcast.com.au/). 

## Install
From the directory run the following command:
```bash 
pip install --user solcast
```
!!! tip

    for full functionality install **all**: `pip install --user solcast[all]`

## Usage
!!! warning 

    To access Solcast data you will need a [commercial API key](https://toolkit.solcast.com.au/register). If you have the API key already,
    you can use it with this library either as an environment variable called SOLCAST_API_KEY,
    or you can pass it as an argument `api_key` when you call one of the library's methods. 

Fetching live radiation and weather data:

```py
from solcast import live

res = live.radiation_and_weather(
    latitude=-33.856784,
    longitude=151.215297,
    output_parameters=['air_temp', 'dni', 'ghi']
)
```

as a Pandas DataFrame

```python
df = res.to_pandas()
```
!!! info
    Pandas is not installed by default to keep the environment light. It is installed with the [all] tag
